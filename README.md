### Project Overveiw
---
The Survey Data Transformation project focuses on improving the usability and clarity of raw survey data. The goal is to create a more understandable dataset that seamlessly integrates with visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. By leveraging Python, Pandas, and associated packages, we transform the initial survey data into a structured format that facilitates efficient analysis and visualization.

### Project Objectives
- Data Cleaning and Enhancement: Meticulously cleaning and preprocessing the raw survey data. This involves handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring data consistency.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to provide additional context and insights. These engineered features enhance the overall quality of the dataset.
- Optimized Data Structure: The project ensures that the transformed data is well-organized and ready for visualization. We focus on appropriate data types, efficient storage, and 
  compatibility with visualization tools.


### Data Sources

Data - Survey Output: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Data - Survey Output" file, containing detailed information about survey carried out.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning and formatting [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel)
- Visual Studio Code - Debugging and running Python scripts. [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Pandas - Filtering, Merging and reshaping datasets. [Download here](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Openpyxl - openpyxl is a Python library for reading and writing Excel files (.xlsx).

### Steps
- Data Cleaning: By addressing inconsistencies, outliers, and any anomalies in the 
  survey data. This step ensures that the dataset is reliable and accurate.
- Data Manipulation: Using Python and Pandas, the data is reshape to meet specific 
  requirements. This includes merging datasets, aggregating information, and 
  creating calculated fields.
- Client Collaboration: Throughout the process, while collaborating closely with the 
  client to understand their needs and tailor the data transformation accordingly.

### Benefits
- Improved Insights: The transformed dataset allows for clearer insights and 
  informed decision-making.
- Efficient Visualization: Users can seamlessly visualize survey results using 
  tools like Power BI and Tableau.
- Client Satisfaction: By meeting the clientâ€™s requirements, this ensure ease of use 
  and satisfaction.

### Conclusion
The project bridges the gap between raw survey data and meaningful visualizations.
